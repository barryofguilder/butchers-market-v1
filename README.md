# Things to do

Here's a list of things that still need to be worked on:

* Navbar - Font characteristics (Change to Bold), slightly less padding inbetween links, "down arrow" adjacent to "MORE"

* Carousel - Make mobile display a seperate set of images. Reasons - Appearance, smaller file size

* Social Media - Create small logos to float on the top left (position debatable) of the carousel

* Images - 5 carousel images selected from the below to visually summarize the store for "index.html"

         - 5 carousel images for "meat.html"

         - 5 carousel images for "deli.html"

         - 5 carousel images for "grocery.html"

         - 5 carousel images for "dining.html"

         - 5 carousel images for "beverage.html"

         - A background image needs to be taken for "contact.html"
